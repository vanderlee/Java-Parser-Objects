Interfaces and basic classes of the framework.
<p/>
{@link pobs.PParser} is the central class of POBS. All concrete parsers extend
this abstract class. 
In package <a href="parser/package-summary.html"><code>pobs.parser</code></a> small
concrete general-purpose parsers are defined. To create your own parser
you just use these predefined parsers as building block. They are defined
in such a way that it is easy to build a parser from an (E)BNF syntax 
definition.
<p/>
The following class diagram gives an overview of the architecture of the 
framework:

After parsing a parser returns a {@link pobs.PMatch} instance which tells 
whether parsing was successful or not. One can attach a
{@link pobs.PAction} for both cases.
<p/>
For parsing a parser needs a {@link pobs.PScanner} which capsulates the source
to be parsed and a {@link pobs.PContext}. The parser context holds
<ul><li>a {@link pobs.PDirective} object giving directives for parsing
        (e.g. do case-sensitive parsing or not),
    </li>
    <li>an optional {@link pobs.PTarget} manipulated by actions,</li>
    <li>an optional {@link pobs.PErrorHandler} which will be notified
        by the parser in case of unsuccessful parsing.
    </li>
</ul>    
One can add {@link pobs.PControl} objects to a parser. They modify the
<code>PDirective</code> object before parsing.
